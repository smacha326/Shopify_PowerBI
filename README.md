# Shopify_PowerBI
This was my first PowerBI project I created during my time as a BIA trainee at TripleTen. It includes simulated online shopping info. 
## About the Data

The data comes from four tables in `shopify.xlsx`:

- **apps** — info about the apps themselves  
- **apps_categories** — links apps to their categories  
- **categories** — lists app categories  
- **reviews** — user reviews, ratings, and developer replies

## What I Did

### Part 1: App Landscape  
- Counted how many unique apps there are  
- Made a line chart to show review counts over time  
- Made a scatterplot comparing number of reviews with average rating  

### Part 2: Reviews  
- Created a new column called `helpful_reviews` to weigh reviews by how helpful they are  
- Made a card showing the average helpfulness score  
- Created a column to see if the developer replied to reviews  
- Made a scatterplot comparing ratings with developer replies  

### Part 3: App Reviews  
- Linked reviews to apps  
- Made bar charts showing ratings and helpful reviews by developer  
- Found out which developers reply most often, focusing on those with lots of reviews
